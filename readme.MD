# SKY DEFENDER [Click Here][LiveAppUrl]

 A simple web based Game aiming to provide native app like experience by utilizing service workers as in a `PWA`.

## Some cool features

1. Use of plain CSS and Vanilla JS on client side.
2. A simple JSON file based DB with custom CRUD API that uses Node's fs module and it has reasonable error handling. Although Read-write speed is terrible but its fun to implement.
3. Use of canvas API for handling game graphics and media.
4. Use of Service workers to provide native app like experience.
5. Minimalistic backend based on Nodejs 8.3.11 LTS hosted on Heroku's free shared hosting PaaS platform.
6. Automatic deploy on merge to master.
7. The view is mobile friendly, but has many responsive elements for adjusting to wide screens.
8. The use of native fetch api and dynamic HTML content.
